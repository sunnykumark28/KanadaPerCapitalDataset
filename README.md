# Canada Per Capita Income Analysis 📈

This project analyzes Canada’s per capita income data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The main objective of this project is to understand income trends over time and apply basic data analysis and machine learning concepts. The dataset is explored, cleaned, and visualized to identify patterns and relationships within the data.

Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are used for data handling and preprocessing, while Matplotlib is used for visualization. A simple linear regression model is implemented using scikit-learn to predict per capita income based on year-wise data. This helps demonstrate how regression can be applied to real-world economic datasets.

This project is designed for beginners who are learning data analysis and machine learning fundamentals. It serves as a practice project to strengthen concepts like exploratory data analysis, visualization, and model building, and can be included as a basic portfolio project on GitHub
